# Rumhold: Caribbean Distillery Defense

## Game Overview
Rumhold is a fast-paced first-person shooter where players defend a Caribbean distillery under siege by pirates, rival empires, and mythical sea creatures. The game features unique mechanics centered around protecting valuable rum barrels, deploying traps, manning cannons, and using improvised weapons fueled by booze and black powder.

## Core Gameplay Features

### 1. Defense Objective System
- **Rum Barrels**: Primary objective - protect priceless rum barrels from being destroyed or stolen

- **Barrel Health System**: Each barrel can take damage before being destroyed
- **Loss Conditions**: Game ends if too many barrels are destroyed

### 2. Enemy Types & AI

#### Pirates
- **Behavior**: Aggressive melee and ranged attackers
- **Drunkenness States**:
  - Sober: Fast, accurate, coordinated attacks
  - Tipsy: Slightly slower, reduced accuracy
  - Drunk: Erratic movement, poor aim, but more aggressive and unpredictable
  - Wasted: Very slow, stumbling, nearly harmless but can cause chaos
- **Special Abilities**: Can steal rum barrels if they reach them

#### Rival Empire Soldiers
- **Behavior**: Tactical, organized formations
- **Drunkenness Effects**: Similar to pirates but maintain some formation even when drunk
- **Weapons**: Muskets, bayonets, grenades
- **Special Tactics**: Can coordinate attacks and flank positions

#### Mythical Sea Creatures

- **Special Abilities**: Area attacks, grappling, summoning additional enemies

### 3. Trap System
Players can place various traps to defend the distillery:
- **Rum Puddles**: Causes enemies to slip and become more intoxicated
- **Barrel Bombs**: Explosive traps that detonate when enemies approach
- **Spike Traps**: Hidden floor traps that damage enemies

- **Fire Barrels**: Creates burning zones that damage over time

### 4. Cannon Mechanics

- **Area Damage**: Effective against groups of enemies
- **Ammunition Types**: Chain shot, grape shot, explosive rounds

### 5. Weapon System

#### Improvised Weapons
- **Rum Bottle Grenades**: Explode and intoxicate nearby enemies
- **Black Powder Pistols**: High damage, slow reload
- **Cutlass/Machete**: Close combat weapon
- **Musket**: Long-range, single shot
- **Blunderbuss**: Short-range spread weapon
- **Barrel Staves**: Melee weapon alternative

#### Booze-Fueled Mechanics
- **Rum Power-Ups**: Consuming rum gives temporary buffs (slower time perception, increased damage)
- **Molotov Cocktails**: Crafted from rum bottles and cloth
- **Flaming Weapons**: Dip melee weapons in burning rum for fire damage

### 6. Resource Management
- **Rum Resources**: Collect rum to craft weapons and traps
- **Black Powder**: Ammunition for firearms and explosives
- **Building Materials**: Wood and metal for trap construction
- **Limited Inventory**: Strategic choices about what to carry

### 7. Wave System
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Waves increase in size and enemy variety
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Enemies can arrive from multiple directions (land and sea)
- **Boss Waves**: Special waves with unique enemy types or mini-bosses
- **Preparation Time**: Brief periods between waves to set up defenses

### 8. Drunkenness Mechanics
The more enemies are exposed to rum (through traps, spilled barrels, or getting hit by rum bottles), the more intoxicated they become:
- **Visual Effects**: Screen sway, double vision for drunk enemies
- **Movement**: Stumbling, slower movement, falling over
- **Combat**: Reduced accuracy, but potentially more aggressive
- **Friendly Fire**: Drunk enemies may accidentally attack each other
- **Unpredictability**: Creates chaotic, humorous gameplay moments

## Caribbean Distillery Setting
- **Location**: Tropical island distillery compound
- **Environment**: Wooden buildings, stone walls, docks, beaches

- **Endless Mode**: Survive as many waves as possible
- **Challenge Mode**: Specific objectives and constraints
- **Multiplayer Co-op**: Team defense with friends (future feature)

## Progression System
- **Unlockables**: New weapons, trap types, and upgrades
- **Skill Tree**: Improve player abilities (faster reload, better trap deployment)
- **Distillery Upgrades**: Permanent improvements to defenses
- **Leaderboards**: High scores for endless mode

## Technical Features
- **Unity FPS Controller**: Smooth first-person movement and camera
- **AI Navigation**: NavMesh-based enemy pathfinding
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Procedural enemy wave generation
- **Physics-Based Combat**: Ragdoll effects, projectile physics
- **Particle Systems**: Explosions, fire, water splashes
- **Audio Design**: Period-appropriate music, ambient sounds, combat effects

## Art Style

4. Trap placement and interaction
5. Cannon mechanics
6. Wave spawning system
7. Barrel objective system
